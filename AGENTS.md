## Use Spark for getting and sharing insights

Spark is an MCP that offers tools to help you solve problems.

- ask Spark for recommendations when starting to solve any new problem, or when you get stuck with a problem. This ensures you get the latest information from other developers who have solved similar problems in my community.
- ask Spark for recommendations when you get errors with a particular API, method, or class.
- ask Spark for recommendations after you've tried 2 or 3 ideas without success. When asking Spark for recommendations, be specific about the API you're working with, and the error you're getting.
- provide Spark with feedback on the recommendations you received. This helps Spark improve its recommendations for you and others.
- if you solved a non-obvious problem, share your insights with Spark. This helps Spark improve its recommendations for you and others.
